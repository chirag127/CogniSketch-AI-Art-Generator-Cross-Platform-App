By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synchronized in timed relation with an image or moving image.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

h. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that others can access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your and Yours have a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use rights arising from Exceptions and Limitations, nor does it intend to limit uses permitted under other applicable licenses.

c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

d. Other rights. The Licensor retains ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Material not granted under this Public License.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions:

a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: (i) retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, a copyright notice, a license notice, a disclaimer notice, and a link to the Licensed Material; (ii) indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and (iii) provide a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material, if any, for purposes of attribution. You may satisfy these conditions in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to include a simple credit line such as "[Title of Licensed Material], by [Creator], under CC BY-NC 4.0." The full Legal Code of this Public License is available at the URI specified in the preamble.

2. If You Share Adapted Material, You must include the following information in a prominent place (if any) and in a manner reasonable for the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Adapted Material: (i) an attribution statement, as required in Section 3(a)(1); (ii) a statement that the material is Adapted Material; and (iii) if possible, a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material.

b. NonCommercial. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so would restrict or impede others' exercise of the Licensed Rights.

c. No additional restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so would restrict or impede others' exercise of the Licensed Rights.

Section 4 – Representations and Warranties.

The Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Liability.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor will not be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any lost profits, revenues, business opportunities, or economic loss, or for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from this Public License or the use of, or inability to use, the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the duration of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here.

b. If You fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. This does not apply if You, with no negligence or fault of Your own, are in breach of Section 3(b) due to an act of a third party and take reasonable steps to cure the breach upon becoming aware of it.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; provided, however, that the Licensor will not use this to terminate this Public License. Your rights under this Public License continue in full force and effect unless terminated as set forth in Section 6(b).

d. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed upon in writing.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from, and independent of, the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is held to be unenforceable, it shall be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable without impairing its intent. If it is not possible to modify a provision to make it enforceable, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remainder of this Public License.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed upon in writing.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You (including, without limitation, the United Nations Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations).
